Great for the jawbone.,Happy,,
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!,Unhappy,,
The mic is great.,Happy,,
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.,Unhappy,,
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts,Unhappy,,
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!,Happy,,
Needless to say,Unhappy,,
What a waste of money and time!.,Unhappy,,
And the sound quality is great.,Happy,,
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.,Happy,,
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.,Unhappy,,
Very good quality though,Happy,,
The design is very odd,Unhappy,,
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.,Happy,,
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!,Unhappy,,
So Far So Good!.,Happy,,
Works great!.,Happy,,
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.,Unhappy,,
I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions,Unhappy,,
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!,Happy,,
The commercials are the most misleading.,Unhappy,,

This case seems well made.,Happy,,
Disappointed with battery.,Unhappy,,
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.,Unhappy,,
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.,Happy,,
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.,Happy,,

Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.,Happy,,

Buy a different phone - but not this.,Unhappy,,
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.,Unhappy,,
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.,Unhappy,,
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.,Happy,,
Great for iPODs too.,Happy,,
This device is great in several situations:Happy.),Happy,,

A Disappointment.,Unhappy,,
Its not user friendly.,Unhappy,,
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,Unhappy,,
Then I exchanged for the same phone,Unhappy,,
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.,Unhappy,,
This PDA rocks.,Happy,,

I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.,Happy,,
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.,Happy,,

horrible,Unhappy,,
The noise shield is incrediable.,Happy,,
No real improvement.,Unhappy,,
Razr Battery - Good buy.,Happy,,
Keep up the good work Amazon!!,Happy,,
They refuse to refund or replace.,Unhappy,,
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.,Unhappy,,
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,Unhappy,,
Great case and price!,Happy,,
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,Unhappy,,
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk,Happy,,
Small,Happy,Happy,
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,Happy,,
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,Unhappy,,
I am glad I purchased it.,Happy,,
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,Unhappy,,
Perhaps my phone is defective,Unhappy,,
Don't buy this product.,Unhappy,,
sucked,Unhappy,,
No shifting,Happy, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.,Happy
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.,Unhappy,,
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,Unhappy,,
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,Unhappy,,
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it,Happy,Happy,
I love the camera,Happy,,

"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""",Unhappy,,
The battery life is highly unacceptable.,Unhappy,,
That company is a joke.,Unhappy,,
It does everything the description said it would.,Happy,,
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.,Unhappy,,
It works great with a car charger,Happy,,
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures,Unhappy,,
Voice Quality,Unhappy,,
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size,Happy,Happy,
Better than expected.,Happy,,
It feels poorly constructed,Unhappy,,
Battery is holding up well.,Happy,,
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.,Unhappy,,
I only used it two days,Unhappy,,

Sprint - terrible customer service.,Unhappy,,
Linked to my phone without effort.,Happy,,

What possesed me to get this junk,Unhappy,,
Piece of trash.,Unhappy,,
A pretty good product.,Happy,,
This is a great phone!.,Happy,,
For the price on Amazon,Happy,,
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.,Happy,,
The real killer is the volume,Unhappy,,
Those phones are working just fine now.,Happy,,

Poor Construction.,Unhappy,,
This is infuriating.,Unhappy,,
Overall,Happy,,
Sprint charges for this service.,Unhappy,,
It is cheap,Unhappy,,
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.,Happy,,
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.,Unhappy,,
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 5Unhappy cent's up-and-coming.,Happy,,
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5Unhappy2Unhappy is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.,Happy,,
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.,Happy,,
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E7Happy5.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,Unhappy,,
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.,Unhappy,,
Poor product.,Unhappy,,
However I needed some better instructions.,Unhappy,,
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,Unhappy,,
Worked very well paired with a Treo 7UnhappyUnhappyw and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).,Happy,,
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens,Unhappy,,
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS,Unhappy,,
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.,Happy,,
Plus,Unhappy,,
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,Happy,,
Very Dissapointing Performance.,Unhappy,,
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.,Unhappy,,
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.,Unhappy,,
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,Unhappy,,
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.,Happy,,
Don't bother - go to the store.,Unhappy,,
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.,Happy,,
You get what you pay for I guess.,Unhappy,,
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.,Happy,,
These are fabulous!,Happy,,
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.,Happy,,
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,Unhappy,,
Very wind-resistant.,Happy,,
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!,Unhappy,,
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.,Happy,,
Great phone.,Happy,,
I'm pleased.,Happy,,
Battery is terrible.,Unhappy,,
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.,Happy,,
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.,Unhappy,,
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.,Unhappy,,
Talk about USELESS customer service.,Unhappy,,
"It felt too light and ""tinny."".",Unhappy,,
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.,Unhappy,,
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.,Happy,,
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.,Happy,,
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.,Happy,,
Does everything it should and more.,Happy,,
I could not recommend these more.,Unhappy,,
Nice Sound.,Happy,,
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.,Happy,,
Setup went very smoothly.,Happy,,
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,Unhappy,,
"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design.",Unhappy,,
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,Unhappy,,
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,Unhappy,,
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.,Unhappy,,
Truly awful.,Unhappy,,
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).,Happy,,
And none of the tones is acceptable.,Unhappy,,
camera color balance is AWFUL.,Unhappy,,
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!,Happy,,
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.,Unhappy,,
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.,Happy,,
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,Unhappy,,
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.,Unhappy,,
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!,Unhappy,,
Works well.,Happy,,
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.,Unhappy,,
Clear crisp sound.,Happy,,
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,Unhappy,,
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.,Unhappy,,
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.,Happy,,
It doesn't make you look cool.,Unhappy,,
You can't beat the price on these.,Happy,,
lightweight and works well.,Happy,,
So just beware.,Unhappy,,
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.,Happy,,
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,Unhappy,,
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,Happy,,
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.,Unhappy,,
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.,Happy,,
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.,Unhappy,,
Poor quality.,Unhappy,,
"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!.",Happy,,
Not worth it.,Unhappy,,
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.,Unhappy,,
It was a great phone.,Happy,,
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,Unhappy,,
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.,Happy,,
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!,Happy,,
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,Unhappy,,
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,Happy,,
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.,Happy,,
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,Unhappy,,
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.,Happy,,
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.,Unhappy,,
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.,Happy,,
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.,Happy,,
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros,Unhappy,,
Krussel Always good.,Happy,,
The design is very good.4.,Happy,,
I great reception all the time.,Happy,,

Does not fit.,Unhappy,,
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r45Unhappy slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.,Happy,,
disappointing.,Unhappy,,
Blue Ant is easy to use.,Happy,,
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,Happy,,
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.,Unhappy,,
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,Unhappy,,
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.,Happy,,
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.,Unhappy,,
The sound quality is excellent as well.,Happy,,
Its the best headset I have used.,Happy,,
Would not reccommend.,Unhappy,,
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.,Happy,,
Just what I wanted.,Happy,,
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,Unhappy,,
wont work right or atleast for me.,Unhappy,,
"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.",Unhappy,,
Great product.,Happy,,
Crisp and Clear.,Happy,,
AFter the first charge kept going dead after Happy2 minutes.,Unhappy,,
The reception has been generally good.,Happy,,
Great bluetooth!.,Happy,,
I highly recommend this case.,Happy,,
WORTHWHILE.,Happy,,
This is a great deal.,Happy,,
I am sorry I made this purchase.,Unhappy,,
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,Unhappy,,
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,Unhappy,,
It was horrible!.,Unhappy,,
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,Unhappy,,
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,Unhappy,,
They work about 2 weeks then break.,Unhappy,,
It is simple to use and I like it.,Happy,,
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,Unhappy,,
NOT WHAT I WANTED.,Unhappy,,
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.,Happy,,
Great Phone.,Happy,,
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.,Happy,,
Perfect for the PS3.,Happy,,
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.,Happy,,
$5Unhappy Down the drain.,Unhappy,,
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.,Unhappy,,
For the price this was a great deal.,Happy,,
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!,Happy,,
Does Not Work.,Unhappy,,
The reception through this headset is excellent.,Happy,,
2 thumbs up to this seller,Happy,,

#Happy It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.,Happy,,
Battery charge-life is quite long.,Happy,,
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.,Happy,,
Battery has no life.,Unhappy,,
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.,Unhappy,,

Doesn't do the job.,Unhappy,,
I would recommend it.,Happy,,
Plan on ordering from them again and again.,Happy,,
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.,Happy,,

Unfortunately it did not work.,Unhappy,,
All three broke within two months of use.,Unhappy,,

I don't like this Nokia either.,Unhappy,,
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,Unhappy,,
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.,Unhappy,,
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!,Unhappy,,
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.,Unhappy,,
It's not what it says it is.,Unhappy,,
Stay Away From the Q!.,Unhappy,,
Used and dirty.,Unhappy,,
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !,Unhappy,,
Not good enough for the price.,Unhappy,,
I bought two of them and neither will charge.,Unhappy,,
It looks very nice.,Happy,,
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.,Happy,,
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.,Unhappy,,
Comfortable in my hand.,Happy,,
Just does not work.,Unhappy,,
Poor Reliability.,Unhappy,,
(It works!),Happy,,

Everything about this product is wrong.First,Unhappy,,
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,Happy,,
Terrible phone holder.,Unhappy,,
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.,Happy,,
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.,Happy,,
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.,Unhappy,,
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.,Unhappy,,
How stupid is that?,Unhappy,,
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.,Happy,,
So I bought about HappyUnhappy of these and saved alot of money.,Happy,,
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.,Unhappy,,
Couldn't figure it out,Unhappy,,
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.,Unhappy,,
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.,Happy,,
Works for me.,Happy,,
much better than the hard plastic cases.,Happy,,
It also had a new problem.,Unhappy,,
Happy so far!.,Happy,,
cool phone.,Happy,,
Works good.,Happy,,
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.,Happy,,
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.,Unhappy,,
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.,Unhappy,,
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!,Unhappy,,
Never got it!!!!!,Unhappy,,
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.,Unhappy,,

It didn't charge for me.,Unhappy,,
This is the phone to get for 2UnhappyUnhappy5.... I just bought my S7HappyUnhappya and all I can say is WOW!,Happy,,

Excellent product.,Happy,,
Earbud piece breaks easily.,Unhappy,,
Lousy product.,Unhappy,,
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.,Unhappy,,
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.,Happy,,
SWEETEST PHONE!!!,Happy,,
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.,Happy,,
Not enough volume.,Unhappy,,
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory,Unhappy,,
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.,Unhappy,,
don't waste your money.,Unhappy,,
